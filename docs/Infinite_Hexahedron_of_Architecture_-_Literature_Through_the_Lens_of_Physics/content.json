A research paper analyzing Infinite Hexahedron of Architecture (\uac74\ucd95\ubb34\ud55c\uc721\uba74\uac01\uccb4), a poem by the modernist Korean writer Yi Sang, from an expressive perspective through the lens of physics.",

While this idea is fascinating, a thorough understanding requires deep knowledge of spatial geometry and its four-dimensional extensions\u2014concepts far beyond my grasp. As someone who abandoned geometry the moment vectors and three-dimensional shapes appeared in my math class, I must admit defeat. (I still wonder how those gifted in math can visualize 3D structures in their heads. The only math I understand is statistics.)",

If a family lacked a son to continue its bloodline, they would often adopt a male child from a close relative to ensure the lineage survived.

His avant-garde style quickly gained attention, allowing him to connect with prominent literary figures of the time.

Though his imprisonment lasted only a month, his condition worsened significantly. He passed away in Tokyo in 1937 at the young age of 26.",
