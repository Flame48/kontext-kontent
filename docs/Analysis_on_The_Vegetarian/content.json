Among international readers, she is best known for her novel The Vegetarian , a work composed of three interconnected short stories: \ucc44\uc2dd\uc8fc\uc758\uc790 ( The Vegetarian ), \ubabd\uace0\ubc18\uc810 ( Mongolian Mark ), and \ub098\ubb34 \ubd88\uaf43 ( Flaming Trees ). While each section has a different narrator, the central figure remains Yeong-hye, a woman who first refuses to eat meat, then gradually rejects all food, ultimately believing that she can survive solely on sunlight, as if she were a tree.",
