While long novels offer the luxury of prolonged engagement with a story, they often demand an immense memory load\u2014recalling details from volumes past or keeping track of countless characters. For a reader like me, who enjoys letting my thoughts wander while simultaneously visualizing the setting and atmosphere, lengthy novels can be overwhelming. (That said, I do not dislike them; after all, the Harry Potter series remains one of the most enjoyable reads of my life.)",

It offers a well-paced novella-length story with rich background descriptions detailed enough for the reader to feel as though they are walking through the streets of 1930s Gyeongseong (modern-day Seoul) alongside the protagonist. While this novel had a significant impact on Korean literary history, it remains relatively obscure. Since half the joy of writing is self-satisfaction, I decided to discuss it regardless of its niche status.",

After Korea\u2019s liberation, he moved to North Korea, and his later life remains largely unknown. One of the many pen names he used was \u201cKubo,\u201d though the character \u201cKubo\u201d in the novel is written with different Chinese characters. This has led many scholars to view the novel as an autobiographical reflection of the author\u2019s own experiences. Park Taewon was considered highly educated for his time\u2014during an era when even completing high school was seen as a mark of scholarship, he attended Hosei University in Japan before returning to Gyeongseong. His works are known for their meticulous background descriptions, vividly capturing early 20th-century Gyeongseong.",
