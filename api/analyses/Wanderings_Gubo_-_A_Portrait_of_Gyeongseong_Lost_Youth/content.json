The Taish\u014d era was the Japanese imperial calendar system in use during Japan\u2019s colonial rule over Korea. Traditionally, each emperor's reign determined a new era name, and the first year of that reign was called \u201cYear 1.\u201d When the emperor died or abdicated, a new era name would begin. To put this into context, the Gregorian calendar we use today follows the Anno Domini (A.D.) system, where the birth of Jesus Christ marks Year 1, and the current year, 2025, represents 2025 years since that event. Similarly, \u201cTaish\u014d 12\u201d means the 12th year of Emperor Taish\u014d\u2019s reign\u20141923 in the Gregorian calendar. The other coins are from different years in that era.",
