The reason? A single book: Human Acts . This novel, celebrated both domestically and internationally, was enough to provoke political backlash.

Nearly two decades earlier, in 1961, Park Chung-hee had staged a coup, claiming to restore stability, and ruled as a dictator until he was abruptly assassinated by one of his closest aides. His sudden death exposed the fragility of a regime built on a single leader\u2019s charisma. In the political vacuum, a new president was elected through legal procedures, and martial law was declared. However, unlike Park, the new leader lacked the same authoritative presence, leading to an imbalance of power.",

Due to internal divisions within the pro-democracy movement, Roh managed to win with only 30% of the vote. The remnants of the dictatorship strategically incorporated former democracy activists into their party, blurring ideological lines and ensuring their political survival.
