He is well known for his radical disregard for conventional grammar and punctuation, as well as his experimental use of numbers and mathematical symbols. While his novels are somewhat comprehensible, most of his poetry falls into the category of so-called \"hermetic poetry\" (\ub09c\ud574\uc2dc), seemingly not meant to be fully understood but rather an exploration of unconventional forms of expression.",
