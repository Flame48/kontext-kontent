A fascinating example can be found in the way biblical names were rendered in early Korean translations of the Bible. Unlike modern standardized transliterations, these phonetic adaptations were based on how Korean speakers at the time actually heard and reproduced foreign sounds. This phenomenon reveals key aspects of Korean phonology and its interaction with loanword adaptation.",
