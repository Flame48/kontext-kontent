Although I had seen headlines about the global popularity of Korean dramas, I was skeptical\u2014largely due to the sensationalism of Korean media. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Korean baseball continued while other leagues paused, and the media exaggerated its foreign popularity. So when I saw similar claims about K-dramas, I assumed it was more of the same. But hearing non-Koreans casually engage in thoughtful conversations about Squid Game made the global impact feel tangible and surprising.",
