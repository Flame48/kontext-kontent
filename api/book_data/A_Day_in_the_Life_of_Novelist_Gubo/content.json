Written by Park Taewon, one of the leading literary figures of 1930s Korea, the novel captures a single day in the life of Gubo, a young and introspective writer, as he walks through the streets of Gyeongseong (colonial-era Seoul).",

In between, he traverses the city, meets old acquaintances, visits a newspaper office, stops by a caf\u00e9, and spends time in various urban neighborhoods. Yet what sets the novel apart is not its sequence of events, but its rich internal monologue and observational detail. Gubo\u2019s thoughts drift between past memories, social concerns, artistic frustrations, and the existential solitude of a colonial intellectual. Rather than a plot-driven narrative, the novel is a lyrical and psychological journey, portraying the fragmented experience of life in a rapidly modernizing society under Japanese rule.",

The novel is notable for its cinematic qualities\u2014zooming in on street signs, shop windows, conversations, and facial expressions\u2014creating a literary montage of a city in flux. Through Gubo\u2019s seemingly mundane journey, the novel examines themes of alienation, creative anxiety, and the role of the artist in society.",
